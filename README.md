# Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- PIP (Usually comes with python, unless you're on some exotic linux distro)
    - Dependencies for the script (Only "pillow" as of now) are being installed automatically from the script at
      runtime.

# How to use:

- Download or clone this repo (Download is recommended, because with cloning it'll retain info to this repo)
- Work on your psd-files inside the "src" directory.
- When done, run the "build.py" script. It will convert all psd's to png's and put them into "assets" so they can be
  read by minecraft.
- Reload your resources ingame, and you're good to go.
